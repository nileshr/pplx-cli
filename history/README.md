# History

This folder contains detailed markdown records of your Perplexity queries.

## Structure

- `records/` - Individual markdown files for each query, named by date and query slug

Each markdown file includes:

- The original query
- Full response from Perplexity
- Sources/citations
- Statistics (tokens, duration, model used)

## Note

The `records/` folder is gitignored by default. These are personal query history files stored locally.
